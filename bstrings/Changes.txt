NEW: Detect .net 4.6 on start up. Exit if not found.

CHANGE: Display any error messsages on cmdline vs just showing help
CHANGE: check for errors in regex pattern before opening file, catch bad regex patterns up front


TODO

Multithreaded. Do total chunks/2 for thread count?

Save regex patterns to file for reuse later (if not in included list)
